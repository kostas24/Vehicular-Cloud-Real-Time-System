## Purpose: to build a management system to hypothetically provide users in need of computational 
power with users who are willing to “lend” out their vehicle hardware. 
An Admin has control over whether to accept or reject a job.

## How to Use: Run Controller.java , then run Runnable.java . 
Create a accounts for vehicle renters and vehicle owners.
Login to "Admin" by hitting login button, then typing "admin" for both username & password.
You are able to view Pending jobs with the "view requests button" where you can accept
or reject a job (by their email).
If accepted, their information will be written to a text file and a mySQL database.
If rejected, their information will not be recorded.
To login to the accounts you created, simply go back to the hopepage/dashboard.
Type in the email of the user and the password can be anything.
The user will receive a popup saying if the job was accepted or denied.
